This is an audio converter for your library. Select the folder with FLAC songs you want to convert to MP3 or ALAC, and with one click it will be converted into your favorite compressed 20 kHz format. Totally inferior, but hey, it’s compatible with your old iPod. Cool.
- The output will be a mirror of the selected folder and subfolders with converted files
- FFmpeg is required.
- The releases include FFmpeg bundled in the executable file.
